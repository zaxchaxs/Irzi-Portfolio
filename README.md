# Irzi Rahmatullah Portfolio

This portfolio website project is one of my learning outcomes about NextJS. By utilizing the Framer Motion framework for animations and ReactFullPage for full-screen display, along with TailwindCSS, it makes the website's appearance more attractive and dynamic. Not only that, but this project also incorporates data from JSON in its presentation, making it flexible and easily customizable.
